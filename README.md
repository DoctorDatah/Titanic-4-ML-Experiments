## Background

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

Approximaty: 7 out of 11, 68% of people died in that acident.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

## Goal

To build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

## Framing the Problem

The appropriate techniques can be used for this problem
- Supervised Learning 
- Classification
- Off-line Learning

## Assumptions 

- Women are more likely to survive. As they would have given high precedence. 
- Children and Seniors would have given high precedence, but they might have not survived the harsh environment long enough.

## Variable Notes
pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
